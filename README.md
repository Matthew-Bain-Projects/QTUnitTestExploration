# QTUnitTestExploration
Decided to See How To Run Multiple QTTest Projects. This project is a mock idea for how I could structure a testing project to be able to run all tests with a click sometimes and sometimes run only a subset. Included is a "RunAllTests.sh" script that does the heavy lifting. I did have to change the build directory in the QTcreator GUI, but everything else should run out of the box.
